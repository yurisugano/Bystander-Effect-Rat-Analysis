Data analysis for "The Bystander Effect in Rats"

This project investigates the presence of the Bystander Effect in rats. The data analysis component consists on identifying differences between conditions with naive bystanders or confederate bystanders (rats pharmacologically treated not to help). In addition, shuffles of two or three single rat experiments allowed us to investigate the expected additive effects of additional rats. We concluded that the results observed could not be explained by the increased number of rats alone.
