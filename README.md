## Bystander Effect in Rats 🐭

### Overview

#### What's This All About? 🤔

Do rats change their behavior based on the actions of their rat buddies? That's exactly what we've delved into! This project explores the Bystander Effect, but with a rodent twist. 

#### Problem Statement 🎯

You've likely heard of the [Bystander Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) in humans, but what happens when we bring rats into the picture? Traditional statistical methods struggle to capture the nuances when multiple "test subjects" (in this case, rats) are in the mix. This project pioneers a solution to that challenge, dissecting the behavioral intricacies of rats influenced by their peers.

Our findings have already made waves in the academic realm, finding a home in the prestigious [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb4205) journal. Beyond that, the analytical methods employed can be applied in studies involving multi-subject treatments, opening up new avenues in behavioral science.
